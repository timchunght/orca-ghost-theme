				<h2>Post Types</h2>
				<p>Orca has 3 different post styles (excluding the featured post layout) which allows you adjust how your post appears within the post list. These 3 post styles are enabled using the post tags within the Ghost editor. If a post type tag is not set the default post style will be used using a plain text header and no image. These tags are hidden and will not appear on the post page. The Feature and Banner post styles both use a post image, which has to be set within the post editor by placing an image with a specific alt tag between your first and second paragraph. E.g.</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint">This is my first paragraph of text.

![postimage]

This is my second paragraph of text.</pre>
				<p>Previews of each post type can be seen on the live preview <a href="http://orca.ecko.me">here.</a> Hover of the navigation icon, and follow to the <strong>Post Types</strong> drop down.
				<h3>Feature</h3>
				<p>This style will include a large image at the top of the post, with the post header within it. Two paragraphs of the post will be shown on post list pages. To enable this post style add the tag 'feature' as the last post tag. (Note this is not the same as a Featured post)</p>
				<h3>Banner</h3>
				<p>This style will include a small banner image at the top of the post, with the post header below it. To enable this post style add the tag 'feature' as the last post tag.</p>
				<h3>Standard (Default)</h3>
				<p>If neither of the above post styles are used, the post will default two the standard post styles, which incudes the post title and first paragraph of text.</p>
				<hr/>
				<h2>Feature Configuration &amp; Use</h2>
				<h3>Featured Posts</h3>
				<p>Featured blog posts have an adjusted header, which displays a large cover image and the title of the post. This image can be customized by the user, or left blank for the default dark background.</p>
				<p>Creating a featured post is simple, first create your standard blog post and add your content. Within the post markdown editor add the following code between the first and second paragraph <strong>![postimage]</strong>. This will create an image upload area in the live preview section of the editor. Upload the image you wish to use as the featured background. For improved performance its recommended that any large images are reduced in size (1680 width is recommended) and compressed. Below is an example of how the code might look in your editor.</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint">This is my first paragraph of text.

![postimage]

This is my second paragraph of text.</pre>
				<p>Once you have added content to your post, and a feature image, publish the post. Return back to the posts index, and click the star on the submitted blog post. The post is now featured and will contain a full page header. Previous posts can by also be featured by clicking the star icon, and adding a post image.</p>
				<h3>Social Network Profiles</h3>
				<p>Orca includes support for linking to social platforms such as facebook, twitter, github etc. within the sidebar and the footer of each page. Configure your social links by editing the file <strong>Orcatheme/partials/social_sidebar.hbs</strong> for the sidebar and <strong>Orcatheme/partials/social_footer.hbs</strong> for the footer.</p>
				<p>Edit each lines href="" value, including your profile link for that particular platform. Delete any lines for platforms which are not wanted. They can be added again later at any time by copying them from the original source file. Remember to edit for the sidebar and footer links.</p>
				<h3>Static Pages &amp; Navigation</h3>
				<p>Ghost release 0.4.0 added support for static pages which can be added to your blogs navigation. In order to create a static page create a new blog post with the pages content and header. Once created click the post settings icon and tick to enable the <strong>Static Page</strong> option. Copy the post <strong>URL</strong> which is shown in the same window. This URL needs to be added to the navigation section of the theme files. Open up <strong>Orcatheme/partials/navigation.hbs</strong> and edit the navigation sections to include the link to your page and a desired name. Below is an example of the navigation section. Reference Lines 30 &amp; 44.</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint">{{! ADD STATIC PAGE LINKS HERE }}
{{! REMOVE THE THREE DEFAULT LINKS BELOW IF NOT USED }}
{{! REPEAT BY ADDING LINKS TO THE FOOTER BELOW AS COMMENTED}}
&lt;ul class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;<br/>	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>	&lt;li&gt;<br/>		&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Features &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-down&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br/>		{{! BELOW IS A NESTED MENU }}<br/>		&lt;ul&gt;<br/>			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Nested Option One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Nested Option Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Nested Option Three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>		&lt;/ul&gt;<br/>	&lt;/li&gt;<br/>	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
				<h3>Disqus Comments</h3>
				<p>Setting up Discus comments for individual posts is simple. Firstly you will need an Disqus account, which can be obtained freely at <a href="http://disqus.com">http://disqus.com</a>. Once you have created an account and setup your shortname, enter it into the theme configuration which can be found within the <strong>/assets/js/global.min.js</strong> file.</p>
				<p>Once you have setup and enabled comments, all administration for comments can be done via the Disqus control panel. To access this admin panel navigate to <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, and select <strong>'Admin'</strong> located in the header of the page. If at any time you wish to disable comments, you can do this by deselecting the <strong>'Use Disqus Comments'</strong> theme option.</p>
				<h3>Google Comments</h3>
				<p>If you prefer, you can enable Google Plus comments to replace Disqus comments. To do this enable the setting in the configuration file located at <strong>/assets/js/global.min.js</strong>. If a Disqus shortname is set, this will override Google Comments, so set Disqus to blank <strong>''</strong>. Please note, Google Plus Comments are unsupported by Google, and we recommend that Disqus is used instead. The implementation used to integrate Google Comments is not official or documented, and may stop working without notice at any time.</p>
				<h3>Tag Cloud</h3>
				<p>On the sidebar of each page is a tag cloud which needs to be manually edited with your most popular tags, or main categories. To do this open the <strong>orcatheme/partials/tags.hbs</strong> file, and observe the structure of the default links. To add a new tag copy and paste the line from an existing tag and edit the appropriate fields. Delete the lines of unwanted tags to remove them, such as the theme examples.</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint">{{! ADD COMMON TAGS HERE FOR SIDEBAR }}
{{! REMOVE THE DEFAULT TAGS BELOW IF NOT USED }}
&lt;ul class=&quot;tags_list&quot;&gt;<br/>	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{@blog.url}}/tag/taghere&quot;&gt;taghere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
				<h3>Syntax Highligting</h3>
				<p>Orca comes with the Rainbow plugin preinstalled. This plugin will syntax highlight and format any code which you post in your blog. A code block can be created by tabing in a section of code twice in the markdown editor, or by 4 spaces. Too disable this feature edit the theme configuration file located at <strong>/assets/js/global.min.js</strong>.</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint">// THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF JS SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
var server = net.createServer(function (socket) {
  socket.write('Echo server\r\n');
  socket.pipe(socket);
});
server.listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');</pre>
				<h3>Post Annotations</h3>
				<p>Within your blog posts you can include annotations for paragraphs of text, images, and code. To do this requires using some <strong>HTML</strong> markup inside the post editor. You can copy and paste the section of code below into your editor and replace the comments with the desired content. If you are annotating code sections, you may need to wrap the code in &lt;code&gt; and &lt;pre&gt; tags.</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;div class=&quot;annotation&quot;&gt;
ADD YOUR MAIN CONTENT HERE E.G. Image, Code.
&lt;div class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Annotation Title Here&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annotation text here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
				<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
				<p>Orca supports Google Analytics on all pages. Enabling this feature requires an active account with the Google Analytics service (<a href="http://analytics.google.com">http://analytics.google.com</a>). Once an account is created, and website registered, the UID code is required which is a similar format to the following: <strong>UA-28282324-1</strong>. Copy this code into the configuration file which can be found at <strong>assets/js/global.min.js</strong>.</p>
				<h3>Grunt (Developers)</h3>
				<p>This feature is intended for developers. Orca implements SASS stylesheets, which compile to CSS. Included with Orca is a Gruntfile which allows easy compiling of SASS into CSS, aswell as minifying all the source files into assets. Providing you have the prerequisites on your server you can install the dependencies using <strong>npm install</strong>. Compile the source using <strong>grunt</strong>. More information on Grunt and its setup can be found at <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">http://gruntjs.com/</a>.</p>
